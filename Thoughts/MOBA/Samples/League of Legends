Wins
Proper sense of progression (power ramps significantly from lv1 to lv30)
Relatively long 'training period' (you are matched against weaker opponents as you level)
Team composition and teamplay strong part of gameplay

Losses
Time commitment wall before you can play at competitive skill level (getting to lv30 takes a long time, runes take time to farm)

Potential Problems
Relatively large power gap at low levels depending on available summoner spells (mostly doesn't matter)
