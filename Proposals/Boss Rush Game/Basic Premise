General idea for this game is to optimize the player experience around fighting and beating relatively intelligent bosses. Intelligent means that they don't
always follow a repeated pattern - at the very least, they react actively to
player actions in interesting ways.

Need to figure out if it's more like a MMORPG (like WoW) or an ARPG
(like Diablo), which changes the emphasis on reaction speed and smooth
gameplay. Most of the mechanics are similar, but the former lends less well to
balancing for solo play compared to the latter, so it'll likely be the latter.

Will probably start with something 2D.
